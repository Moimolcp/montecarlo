# Montecarlo - App

Web app created in Angular and hosted on https://monte--carlo.herokuapp.com/

Monte Carlo methods, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches.
In this case, it is used to calculate the area of a binary image like these:
